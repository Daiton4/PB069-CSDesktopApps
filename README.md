On every seminar there was small work, most times written at the same time with teacher. Most codes are made in hurry just to show some functionality. At the end Final individual project was made every student. Course wass aimed to basics of Win. Forms and WPF.

Seminar project is Demo application (Manager of Tasks with multiple users). Gui is made in WPF, it uses simple backend that provides basic verification and crud operations. MSSQL Database is used (MSSQLLocalDB) with Dapper ORM. In spare time I begun to implement web GUI in ASP.Net. Project comes with instructions and scripts for setting up environment.
